# Introduction
Locates FIX API specification details the tags and values along with description of values for each field for processing locate requests and acceptances from OMS clients. Clear Street currently utilizes FIX 4.2 format.

# Configuring FIX Session
```
// Example Config
[DEFAULT]
ReconnectInterval=5
SenderCompID=LOCATESCLIENT
HeartBtInt=30
SocketAcceptPort=31234
TargetCompID=CLST
HeartBtInt=30
SocketConnectPort=31234
SocketConnectHost=100.0.0.0
BeginString=FIX.4.2

[SESSION]
StartTime=04:00:00
EndTime=22:00:00
```
A FIX session is defined as a unique combination of a `BeginString` (the FIX version number 4.2), a `SenderCompID` (OMS Client ID as defined by Clear Street), and a `TargetCompID`.

A FIX session has an active time period during which all data is transmitted. Clear Street currently accepts connections between 4 AM EST to 10 PM EST on all business days. Clear Street will act as an acceptor and OMS will be the initiator.

A `Logon` message (`Tag 35=A`) must be sent to Clear Street on every business day to indicate the beginning of activity and a `Logout` message (`Tag 35=5`)must be sent to Clear Street indicating an end of activity for that day. 

Clear Street also recommends exchange of heartbeats every 30 seconds by sending a message with `Tag 35=0`.

Clear Street expects every message to have a unique continuous sequence number as part of the message with `Tag 34`. If there are any gaps in sequence numbers, a sequence reset message will be sent to the OMS client with tag `34=4`.

All requests must either provide a `Symbol` (Tag 55) or both `IDSource` (Tag 22) and `SecurityID` (Tag 48) to clearly identify a security. `IDSource` (Tag 22) and `SecurityID` are marked as conditionally required for this purpose.

We support TLS for securing the data over a FIX session. Please contact api-support@clearstreet.io for exchanging keys with Clear Street and for additional details.

# Message Flows

Currently we support two different message flows. All new client implementations should use Preferred Message Flow below.

## Preferred Message Flow
We request all new OMSs to follow this message flow

1. OMS will send a `Quote Request` message to locate securities
2. Clear Street responds by sending a `Quote` message with the located securities information including Locate_ID in `Tag 117`.
3. OMS will send a `New Order` message by setting `Tag 117` with the Locate_ID that Clear Street provided.
4. Clear Street responds by sending an `Execution Report` message with status update such as accepted/expired/etc  in `Tag 39`
5. OMS will send an `Order Cancel Request` message if they would like to decline the offer by setting `Tag 37` with the Locate_ID that Clear Street provided.
5. Clear Street responds with a `Reject` message on any validation/formatting errors.

## Legacy Message Flow 
This flow will be decommissioned in the future once all existing OMSs migrate to the preferred message flow above.

1. OMS will send a `New Order` message to locate securities
2. Clear Street responds by sending an `Execution Report` message with the located securities information including Locate_ID in `Tag 37`.
3. OMS will send a `New Order` message by setting `Tag 117` with the Locate_ID with the status code that Clear Street provided. To accept, OMS need to send Locate_ID,1 for `Tag 117` and to reject OMS need to send Locate_ID,3 for `Tag 117`.
4. Clear Street responds by sending an `Execution Report` message with status update such as accepted/expired/etc in `Tag 39`
